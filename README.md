This is BODIED!

A plugin that allows for dead bodies to be spawned on player death.

Bodies, after 10 seconds, will descend into the ground and despawn! However, while spawned, bodies can also be looted through right clicking them.

If a body is not looted before the 10 seconds are up, all items go back to the player who died. If a body is looted, the items will drop at the player's death location!

This plugin can serve as a fun way to spice up your SMP/Minecraft Server!
